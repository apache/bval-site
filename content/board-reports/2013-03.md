The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303)
specification and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the
foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases.

### Activity ###
Part of the BVal community is engaged at Apache Commons, working on the
[weaver] component (subject of my Fast Feather talk at ApacheCon NA 2013)
which, when completed, is planned to be used in BVal's code.

Mailing list traffic continues to be minimal.

We continue to follow the progress of the Bean Validation specification; its
1.1.0 version is being developed under Red Hat's (open) leadership as JSR-349.
Apache BVal will implement Bean Validation v1.1.0 as soon as is practical.

### Community  ###
Mohammad Nour El-Din has resigned from the PMC.

### Branding ###
The BVal site has been restyled using a Twitter bootstrap foundation, and
incorporating the new logo.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.
