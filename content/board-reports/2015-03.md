The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation specification(s)
and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the foundation on
February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases. Last release was v0.5 in September 2012.

### Activity ###
Our activity level certainly does not mark us as a glamorous project; there has
been a single commit since the report of Q4 2014. Mailing list traffic is
nonexistent. Once again, there is little reason to fear we would be unable to
release from a voting perspective, but our current level of developer "steam" is
such that a release vote is not a concern for the immediate future. All hope is
not lost but volunteer burnout is certainly a factor.

### Community  ###
No changes in community.
Last PMC member added Q4 2013
Last committer added Q3 2013

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.
