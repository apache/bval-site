## Apache BVal Report June 2014 ##

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation specification(s)
and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the foundation on
February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases.

### Activity ###
BVal saw an increase in traffic to its dev@ and user@ mailing lists this
quarter. Several of these threads culminated in contributions of code and
documentation, some of which have already been adopted.

The board may recall the ongoing saga of releasing the Commons Weaver
component for use by BVal; we encountered a small setback after Commons Weaver's 1.0 
release upon discovering a blocking bug in one of *its* dependencies (exposed by
the BVal trunk code). We thus engaged the third Apache community in the chain 
(Geronimo) with the result that Weaver 1.1 is currently undergoing a release 
vote. A la Bullwinkle, "This time for sure!" but we expect to have cleared
the path to finish BVal 1.0 and 1.1 once this is complete.
