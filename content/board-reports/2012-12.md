## Apache BVal Report December 2012 ##

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303)
specification and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the
foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
Apache BVal version 0.5 was released on September 21--just after our last
report to the board!  This was a quick turnaround release, addressing a fairly
serious regression (hence the last report's complete omission of any mention
of an impending release).

### Activity ###
Development has begun to pick back up with some feints at solving one of our
outstanding design issues; this has led to some interesting inter-project
discussion, and looks poised to result in the creation of a new utility
among the libraries provided by Apache Commons.

Mailing list traffic continues to be minimal.

We continue to follow the progress of the Bean Validation specification; its
1.1.0 version is being developed under Red Hat's (open) leadership as JSR-349.
Apache BVal will implement Bean Validation v1.1.0 as soon as is practical.

### Community  ###
No changes in community.

### Branding ###
Re-styling the website to incorporate our new logo remains an open task.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.
