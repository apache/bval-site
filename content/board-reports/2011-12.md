### Apache Bval Quarterly Report December 2011

Bean Validation was accepted into Incubator on 1 March 2010.

The Bean Validation project is an implementation of the Java EE Bean
Validation JSR303 specification.

There are no other important issues open before a possible graduation.
The project has agreed to seek status as a TLP, and has agreed by an internal
vote on its readiness to graduate \[1\].  The primary task outstanding is the
completion of a charter.

### Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of

 * none

### How has the community developed since the last report

 * Mailing list and JIRA activity are extremely quiet.  We attribute this
to the nature of the podling, being but an implementation of a specification,
and the level of achievement of conformity to that specification.

### How has the project developed since the last report

 * we have upgraded to and continue to pass the latest available version of the JSR303 TCK.
 * we continue to track the progress of the JSR303 spec for the future.
