## Apache BVal Report June 2015 ##

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation specification(s)
and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the foundation on
February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
The Apache BVal 1.1.0 release vote passed on June 9, 2015. The formal release
process continues.

### Activity ###
A small flurry of activity has brought the 1.1.0 release to pass. Because Apache
BVal's semantic version numbers are intended to track the version of the Bean
Validation specification targeted, this has resulted in the 1.1.0 release
(implementing Bean Validation 1.1) actually having preceded a 1.0.0 release,
which remains outstanding.
