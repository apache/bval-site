## Apache BVal Report December 2013 ##

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation
specification(s) and related extensions, and became a top-level project of
the foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases.

### Activity ###
Releasing our 1.0 and 1.1 versions, to coincide with Java Bean Validation
1.0 and 1.1 respectively, has been discussed and a basic approach seems to
have been agreed upon.  BVal's developers are busy all over the place
(in many cases with other Apache projects) with a general shortage of 
"round tuits", but we remain optimistic that the releases will be made.

Mailing list traffic picked up a bit this quarter.

### Community  ###
Romain Manni-Bucau has been added to the PMC.

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.
