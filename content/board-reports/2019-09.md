## Project Activity:
Apache BVal 2.0.3 was released on 2019-08-19. A maintenance release
along the 1.1.x branch of activity is planned for the near future.

## Community Health:
With last quarter's addition of a new volunteer to the PMC and
committer roster, our capacity to keep up with maintenance tasks has
increased. Our mailing list traffic is low; as noted in the past
our usual model is frenzied activity for a spec-compliant release,
then the maintenance cycle, much like the proverbial "periods of
boredom punctuated by periods of terror" commonly attributed to war.
Our JIRA activity also reflects this: two issues opened and closed
with patches provided, accepted, and applied during the quarter.
Another issue opened to request a release of those changes on a
dormant line of development (the aforementioned 1.1.3 release).
