## Apache BVal Report May 2012 ##

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303)
specification and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the
foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
BVal proudly made its first non-incubating release, version 0.4, on April 14,
2012. Ours was incorporated into the better-publicized Apache TomEE 1.0 release.

### Activity ###
Since the release of BVal 0.4, there has been no activity to speak of. Our next
goals are to continue improving the codebase for BVal 1.0.

Traffic on the user mailing list remains low/nonexistent.

We continue to follow the progress of the Bean Validation specification; its
1.1.0 version is being developed under Red Hat's (open) leadership as JSR-349.
Apache BVal will implement Bean Validation v1.1.0 as soon as is practical.

### Community  ###
No new faces in the community.

### Branding ###
The task of creating a new project logo remains open.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.
