The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303)
specification and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the
foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No releases since the last report.

### Activity ###
Little development activity of late; most of the BVal team are spread across
various ASF projects, so we've not yet been able to make good on our intentions
to continue improving the codebase towards a 1.0 release.

Traffic on the user mailing list remains low/nonexistent.

We continue to follow the progress of the Bean Validation specification; its
1.1.0 version is being developed under Red Hat's (open) leadership as JSR-349.
Apache BVal will implement Bean Validation v1.1.0 as soon as is practical.

### Community  ###
No changes in community.

### Branding ###
The project has adopted (though not yet re-branded with) a new logo contributed
by Adonis Raduca. The PMC thanks him for his contribution, as well as his
employer, IRIAN Solutions, for his time.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.
