First release of artifacts.
Grow the community and committer base.

### Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of
None at this time.

### How has the community developed since the last report
The community has been focused on resolving TCK failures, with lots of help coming from contributor Carlos Vara.
Apache OpenJPA trunk is now using our artifacts as their default provider for Bean Validation testing.
Two other projects (one at the ASF) have mentioned they are using our artifacts instead of Hibernate.

### How has the project developed since the last report
Confluence is setup as our website and has been fully populated.
SNAPSHOT artifacts are being published to repository.apache.org.
TCK testing is being run by 3 or 4 committers and contributors.
