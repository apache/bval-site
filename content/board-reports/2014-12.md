## Apache BVal Report December 2014 ##

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation specification(s)
and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the foundation on
February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases. Last release was v0.5 in September 2012.

### Activity ###
The Commons Weaver quasi-dependency bottleneck has as long last been resolved
and BVal development has resumed. We continue to work with the Apache TomEE PMC,
who bundle our project and thereby provide a clear barometer for ease of
integration. I note the question on the agenda of whether we have enough
committers to make releases... I assume this refers to BVal, though it could
have referred to Commons as we did spend an unfortunate amount of time blocked
there. While the developer energy of most of the PMC is being expended 
elsewhere, I believe we have strong enough representation amongst the wider 
"ApachEE" (i.e. JEE at Apache) community to be handily able to garner the votes
for a release once we are satisfied with the state of the codebase.

### Community  ###
No changes in community.
Last PMC member added Q4 2013
Last committer added Q3 2013

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.
