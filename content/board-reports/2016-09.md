The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation specification(s)
and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the foundation on
February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases; last BVal release (v1.1.1) was released February 2016.

### Activity ###
Some activity in JIRA and on developer list this quarter. The specification
process for Bean Validation v2.0 proceeds; this will inevitably trigger a round
of future activity for us to make a compliant release.

### Community  ###
No changes in community.

Last quarter the board asked whether BV 2.0 might afford opportunities to
identify and onboard new personnel to the project. That is possible but probably
not especially likely; the PMC would be happy to consider suggestions to enhance
the vitality of the project. However, because BVal is incorporated into Apache 
TomEE and Apache Geronimo, it is to be expected that one or both of these 
projects might provide manpower when necessary to ensure the availability of a 
compliant and compatibly-licensed implementation of the Bean Validation 
specification.
