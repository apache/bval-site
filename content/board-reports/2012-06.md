## Apache BVal Report June 2012 ##

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303)
specification and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the
foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No releases since the last report.

### Activity ###
We've seen just a bit of externally-initiated activity in JIRA this month, a
welcome contribution ensuring our codebase is compatible with some minor
compiler changes in Java 7.  Most of the BVal team are spread across various
ASF projects, so we've not yet been able to make good on our intentions to
continue improving the codebase towards a 1.0 release.

Traffic on the user mailing list remains low/nonexistent.

We continue to follow the progress of the Bean Validation specification; its
1.1.0 version is being developed under Red Hat's (open) leadership as JSR-349.
Apache BVal will implement Bean Validation v1.1.0 as soon as is practical.

### Community  ###
Some interest indicated by an ASF member who had not previously contributed to
BVal.

### Branding ###
IRIAN donated some graphic design resource time to BVal and has given us a
starting point for a new logo.  We have yet to finalize the community's
preferences for how, if at all, it should be changed before adoption, but
IRIAN's efforts are greatly appreciated!

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.
