 - The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation
   specification(s) and related extensions, and became a top-level project of
   the foundation on February 15, 2012.

## Issues:

 - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity:

 - The (new) Apache BVal 2.0 codebase now passes the Java Bean Validation 2.0
   TCK.
 - Apache BVal 2.0 has a dependency on the Apache Commons Weaver component and

 - In the past week we have received a report of a security issue which a member
   of the community has begun to triage.

   afloat.
