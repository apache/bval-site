## Apache BVal Report September 2013 ##

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation
specification(s) and related extensions, and became a top-level project of
the foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases.

### Activity ###
Java Bean Validation v1.1 has been implemented in a branch that successfully
passes the TCK. Previous reports have mentioned that BVal awaited the
availability of the new Commons [weaver] component, which is mostly baked
and should have been released by the time that PMC reports again in
December. The PMC must next determine a strategy to finalize its 1.0 API
and merge this work with that having been done on the 1.1 branch to release
both codebases.

Mailing list traffic continues to be minimal.

### Community  ###
A new committer, Romain Manni-Bucau, has been welcomed to the BVal roster.
Romain is the driving force behind the implementation of spec v1.1.

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.
