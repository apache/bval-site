## Apache BVal Report March 2014 ##

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation specification(s)
and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the foundation on
February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases.

### Activity ###
Development has proceeded at what can charitably be termed a crawl for the past
year while BVal's team have been expending their volunteer energies elsewhere.
A large obstacle has just been removed, however, in the form of the Apache
Commons Weaver component, which has just seen its 1.0 release. This project had
been one of the aforementioned time/energy sinks and was developed for the
express purpose of solving one of BVal's long-standing design problems; speaking
on behalf of the PMC I am hopeful that we can now resume a respectable
development velocity and finally make our 1.0 and 1.1 (implementing,
respectively, the same versions of the Java Bean Validation specification)
releases in the near future.

### Community  ###
No changes in community. Romain Manni-Bucau was added to the PMC during the
previous quarter after having been elected a committer the quarter before that.

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.
