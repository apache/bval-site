## Apache BVal Report June 2013 ##

The Apache BVal project implements the Java EE Bean Validation 1.0 (JSR-303)
specification and related extensions, and became a top-level project of the
foundation on February 15, 2012.

### Releases ###
No new releases.

### Activity ###
BVal has experienced very little activity as of late. As time permits we have
one team member working in the Commons community on a component that will help
simplify BVal's code and, manpower being what it is, other BVal development
has stalled awaiting the availability of this component (Commons [weaver],
which will allow BVal to streamline/simplify the code it uses to operate in
secured Java runtime environments).

Mailing list traffic continues to be minimal.

The Java Bean Validation specification v1.1 has been released last month;
when BVal development resumes in earnest implementing this version of the
specification is a top priority.

### Community  ###
No changes.

### Branding ###
Nothing to report.

### Legal ###
No concerns at present.

### Infrastructure ###
Nothing needed at the moment.
