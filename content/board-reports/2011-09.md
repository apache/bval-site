
Bean Validation was accepted into Incubator on 1 March 2010.

The Bean Validation project is an implementation of the Java EE Bean
Validation JSR303 specification.

There are no other important issues open before a possible graduation.
Actually the project is discussing its graduation as TLP or into
Apache Commons, as natural successor of Commons Validator.

###Any issues that the Incubator PMC or ASF Board might wish/need to be aware of

 * none

###How has the community developed since the last report

 * Users community activity is stable, users slightly decreased the
activity of filling issues on JIRA and asking questions, we suppose
codebase/provided documentation start being mature enough to satisfy
users needs.

###How has the project developed since the last report.

 * Started a 'extras' module development where putting validators
not included in the JSR303 spec.
 * planning the development for implementing next JSR330 spec version.
