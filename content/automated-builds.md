Title: Automated Builds

We're using the Apache Jenkins build server for continuous builds.

### Jenkins Jobs

[Trunk build](http://builds.apache.org/job/BVal-trunk/)
 - This build is set up to check SVN for updates every 30 mins.

[Linux build + stand-alone TCK + deploy](http://builds.apache.org/job/BVal-trunk-linux-tck-deploy/)
 - This build runs every 4 hours (5 minutes past the hour) on the Ubuntu
build agents (two servers which are heavily used and may take more time
between runs) and includes JUnit testing, the TCK in standalone mode and deploys
the SNAPSHOT artifacts to the Nexus repo.

Email notifications to <commits@bval.apache.org.html> are generated by Jenkins
for build failures (and when builds return to normal).
