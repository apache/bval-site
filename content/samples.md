### Apache OpenJPA

The Apache OpenJPA community has created a [Bean Validation Primer](http://openjpa.apache.org/bean-validation-primer.html)
section showing how JPA2 and Bean Validation can be used.  Currently, this
includes an [image-gallery](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openjpa/trunk/openjpa-examples/image-gallery/)
sample which must be built from source.

Additional JPA2 and Bean Validation integration tests can be found under
the [openjpa-integration-validation](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/openjpa/trunk/openjpa-integration/validation/)
 component in the OpenJPA source tree.
