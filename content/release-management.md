Title: Release Management
We'll be using the [Apache Nexus repository](http://repository.apache.org) for

as SVN to control who can publish artifacts using `groupId=org.apache.bval`.

To familiarize yourself with the notions and requirements for releasing
artifacts, please check out the
[Apache Release FAQ](http://www.apache.org/dev/release.html).

As BVal is a graduated Incubator project, the
[Incubator Release Guidelines](http://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html)
may be of interest.
